To set up the database table in mysql carry out the following commands:
mysql -h localhost -u root -p

mysql executable is located in the bin directory of your WAMP/MAMP/XAMPPS/LAMP installation.  
Should already be added as a path variable but if not you will need to run the command from the bin directory.
If asked for a password just hit enter

create database web_apps;
use web_apps;
create table users(
user_id int unsigned zerofill not null auto_increment primary key,
firstname varchar(100),
lastname varchar(100),
username varchar(20),
password char(40)
);

Insert two records into the table:
insert into users(firsname, lastname, username) values('John', 'Smith', 'jsmith');
insert into users(firsname, lastname, username) values('Joe', 'Bloggs', 'jbloggs');
